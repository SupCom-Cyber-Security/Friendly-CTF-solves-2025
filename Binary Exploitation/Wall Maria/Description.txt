The fields beyond Wall Maria are scorched with battle. 
Titans loom over the Survey Corps, and the Beast Titan commands
the chaos with deadly precision.

Your mission: the heart of the enemy lies exposed,
but no one will hand it to you. Scouts whisper of a weak spot,
a place that, if struck, could turn the tideâ€¦
But beware: the Titan does not stay in one place. 
Its position changes with every skirmish, moving like a shadow across the battlefield.
