You’ve arrived at the heart of Wall Rose, where the Survey Corps once clashed with titans.
You’ve trained long, learning to read the walls and the hidden paths within.
Whispers speak of a secret passage, known only to those brave enough to uncover it.
No map or address will be given this time, only your skill and determination will reveal the way.
Now it’s your turn, Cadet: navigate the defenses, align your gear, and uncover the passage.
