Note : When compiled each function of the binary file has an address 
in this program it tells us to give it an address of a function and it will execute that function

in ghidra notice that the win function gives us a shell 

`` system("/bin/sh"); ``

so we need to execute that function

we just give the address provided as input : 0x4011c0

and we we get a shell
