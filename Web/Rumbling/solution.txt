The Vulnerability :
The website uses JWT tokens to track your chosen Titan. There's a security flaw in how it checks these tokens.

The Security Hole:

The server accepts tokens with "none" algorithm

"none" algorithm means no signature check

This lets anyone create fake tokens with any data they want

The Exploitation
Step 1: Get a Normal Token
Pick any Titan (like Attack Titan)

Check your browser cookies for titanToken

This token proves you chose that Titan

Step 2: Create a Fake Token

What to create:

Header: {"alg":"none"}

Payload: {"titan":"Founding Titan"}

Signature: (leave empty)

Step 3: Use the Fake Token
Encode the header and payload (use jwt.io website)

Replace your titanToken cookie with the new token
