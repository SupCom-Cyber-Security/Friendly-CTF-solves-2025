Vulnerability:
The application contains an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. The URL parameter id directly controls which note is displayed, without proper access control checks.

Vulnerability Analysis :
Buttons on the page link to ?id=1 through ?id=9 (regular notes)

The application doesn't verify if users should have access to the requested note ID

Note ID 0 contains the flag but has no associated button

Exploitation :
Since there's no access control on note IDs, we can directly access any note by modifying the URL parameter.

Steps to solve:

Observe the URL pattern when clicking any note button ( http://IP.ADDRESS/notes?id=5)

Manually change the URL parameter to ?id=0

View the hidden note containing the flag
