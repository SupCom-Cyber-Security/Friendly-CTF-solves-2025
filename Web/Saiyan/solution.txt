The Vulnerability :
The web application has client-side restrictions that prevent users from submitting power levels over 9000, but the server actually requires values OVER 9000 to reveal the flag.

Step-by-Step Solution :
1. Understand the Restrictions
The HTML input has max="9000" attribute

JavaScript prevents typing values > 9000

JavaScript blocks form submission if power level > 9000

2. Initial Attempt (Will Fail)
If you try to submit any value â‰¤ 9000, you'll get:
"
Power Level: 5000
Result: FAILED - Power level too low!
Required: Over 9000
"
3. Bypass with Burp Suite
Step 1: Start Burp Suite and configure your browser proxy

Step 2: Submit the form with any value (e.g., 5000)

Step 3: Intercept the request in Burp. You'll see:

"POST /register HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
.....
name=Goku&power_level=5000"
Step 4: Modify the power_level parameter to any value > 9000:

text
name=Goku&power_level=9001
Step 5: Forward the modified request to get the flag
