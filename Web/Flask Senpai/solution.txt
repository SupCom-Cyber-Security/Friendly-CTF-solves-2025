Vulnerability :
The admin password is constructed from multiple components, including a 100-digit random tail. However, bcrypt has a well-known limitation: it only processes the first 72 bytes of any input password. Characters beyond the 72nd position are completely ignored during hash verification.

Key Insight :
The known components of the admin password total exactly 71 characters:

"admin-password" (14 chars)

"uixx-twix-sezd111-azer123-78789id-5656" (38 chars)

"5423-6865-7421-9853" (19 chars)

This means the 72nd character is the first digit of the 100-digit random tail, which needs to be brute forced.

Solution :
Since only one character position matters (the 72nd), and it must be a digit (0-9), we can rapidly test all possibilities:

Use the known 71-character prefix: admin-passworduixx-twix-sezd111-azer123-78789id-56565423-6865-7421-985

Append each digit (0-9) as the 72nd character

One of these 10 attempts will successfully authenticate

The remaining 99 digits of the tail are irrelevant because bcrypt truncates them.
