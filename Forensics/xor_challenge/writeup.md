I have an image of dbz caracter dabura and i made a question line in the front of the image , who has dabura fought in that scene? , which is : gohan
that gohan is the key for xoring
i have a flag i hidden it in the data of the png file after the signature ending of the png data which is IEND , so the solver should extract the string after IEND.B' and xor it with gohan so they get the flag
