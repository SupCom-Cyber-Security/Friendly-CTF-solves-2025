üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The Road to the One Piece

The seas are filled with whispers of treasure.
The Straw Hat Pirates are closer than ever to the legendary One Piece.
But the path is hidden ‚Äî only the Four Road Poneglyphs can reveal the locations that lead to the final island.

After countless battles and storms, the crew reaches the first Road Poneglyph ‚Äî hidden deep within the giant elephant island, Zou.

Ancient inscriptions shimmer under the sunlight.
They do not reveal a treasure‚Ä¶
They do not reveal coordinates‚Ä¶
They reveal a name.

A name of a distant land.
A place where secrets wait‚Ä¶
A place where adventurers must go to continue the quest.
Robin decrypts the poneglyph and realize that it is pointing to the location of the CTF.

The Straw Hats now know: the next clue to the One Piece lies at this location.
And so does your first challenge.
