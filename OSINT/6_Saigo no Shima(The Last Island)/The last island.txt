4 Road Poneglyphs have been deciphered.
Their coordinates are set — but the fourth and final location remains shrouded in mystery.

An old logbook from Gol D. Roger’s ship contains a cryptic note:
“769 21:30 — the last laugh is for the dawn.”

Can you find out what to do with the four locations based on Roger's message. 

The final island’s name is hidden behind this secret.
Solve it, and the One Piece will be yours.
