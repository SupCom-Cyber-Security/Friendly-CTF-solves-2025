With the first clue deciphered at Zou, the Straw Hats set sail toward the next Road Poneglyph — guarded by the formidable Kaido, the "Strongest Creature in the World."

After the epic battle in the skies of Onigashima, Kaido’s Poneglyph was finally within reach.
But unlike Zou, this stone did not reveal its secret easily.
It was encrypted not in the ancient tongue, but in a modern cipher: a string of numbers.

Nami discovered the clue:
820308416509497 — a Facebook reel ID.

Hidden within that fleeting video lies the name of the next destination.
A place tied to Kaido’s past, or perhaps his ambitions…
A place you must find to move closer to Laugh Tale.

Robin warns: “This one is heavily guarded by Kaido’s encrypted legacy. Only the sharpest will unveil the truth.”
